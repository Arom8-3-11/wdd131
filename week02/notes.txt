JavaScript: Fundamental Programming Constructs:

Conditional Satements:
    IF statement: Executesa block of code if a specified condition is true.
    Example:
        if (condition) {
            //code to execute if the condition is true
        }
    condition is evaluated to boolean value, i.e., true/false.. writing condition statements is critical skill in programming. 
    The use of operators and expressions is a key concept in writing condition statements that solve programming problems.

    ELSE statement: Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition in the if statement is false.
    Example:
        if (condition) {
            // executes if condition is true
        }

        else {
            // executes if condition is false
        }

    ELSE If statement: this structure allows for the checking of multiple conditions in sequence.
    Example: 
        if (condition1) {
            //executes if condition1 is true
        }

        else if (condition2) {
            //executes if condition2 is true
        }

        else {
            //executes if none of the conditions are true
        }

Switch Statements: Provides a way to execute selective blocks of code based on the value of an expression.
    Example:
        switch (expression) {
            case value1:
                //executes if expression = value1
                break;
            case value2:
                //executes if expression = value2
                break;
            // ... more cases ...
            default:
                //executes if none of the cases match
        }

Looping Statements:
    FOR Loop: repeats a block of code a specified number of times.
    Example: 
        for (let i = 0; i < 19; i++) {
            //executes in each iteration
        }

    WHILE Loop: repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
    Example:
        while (condition) {
            //executes while the condition is true
        }

    forEach Loop: this loop structure is for arrays. It iterates over each element of the array.
    Example:
        array.forEach(fucntion(element) {
            //executes for each element
        })
