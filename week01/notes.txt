.js is the file extention for JavaScript files

How is JS included on web pages?
    A <script> HTML tag is used to include JavaScript code in an HTML like this:
        <script></script>
    The script tag can be used anywhere on the page.
    This course uses external script files and places the source reference in the head of the HTML document.

What standard way does this course reference JavaScript?
    Use external JavaScript files.
    Place the JavaScript files in the scripts subfolder of the site.
    Reference the script in the head of the HTML document.
    The defer attribute will be used to ensure the HTML loads first.

    <script src="scripts/myscripts.js" defer></script>


Common Misconceptions and Language Issues
    JavaScript is not the same programming language as the Java programming language. They are two different languages with different syntax and purposes.
    The plural form of "code" in programming is just "code", not "codes".
    
    Example: "Please review my code." or "Please review my program". Not "Please review my codes."
    JavaScript is not just for the browser and client-side scripting. With the introduction of server-side frameworks like Node.js, JavaScript can now be used for server-side development as well. JavaScript is a mature language and has become more powerful and versatile over time.





"let" is how you would declare a variable

    Example

    let myName;
    let myAge;




Constants in JavaScript
    As well as variables, you can declare constants. These are like variables, except that:

    you must initialize them when you declare them
    you can't assign them a new value after you've initialized them.
    For example, using let you can declare a variable without initializing it:

    If you try to do this using const you will see an error:





When to use const and when to use let
    If you can't do as much with const as you can with let, why would you prefer to use it rather than let? In fact const is very useful. If you use const to name a value, it tells anyone looking at your code that this name will never be assigned to a different value. Any time they see this name, they will know what it refers to.

    In this course, we adopt the following principle about when to use let and when to use const:

    Use const when you can, and use let when you have to.

    This means that if you can initialize a variable when you declare it, and don't need to reassign it later, make it a constant.
